1. Launch instance with t2.micro
2. open datadoghq.com and create a free account (Try it free for 14 days and monitor as many servers as you like). signup with required details.
3. Install the Datadog Agent on Linux using this command

DD_API_KEY=632bccfc3bae873f6c2ac4624dd6b9ac \
DD_SITE="us5.datadoghq.com" \
bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.datadoghq.com/scripts/install_script_agent7.sh)"

systemctl start datadog-agent
systemctl enable datadog-agent

It can create Host Map for You (have 1 host reporting data to Datadog.
See your hosts in more detail in your Expanded host map.) after waiting for 5 minutes we can access dashboard of a working server or else we can create on our own.

**DataDog takes time for the configuration setup the only disadvantage after that everything is good. it is used to monitor CPU, RAM, DISK, Processes, Containers, etc.

4. we need to setup processes for that go to Host Map -> Processes --> Get started --> Linux --> Agent main configuration file --> vim /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml -->
:set number
/process collection configuration
:1606
--paste this command
process_config:
  process_collection:
    enabled: true

After configuration is complete, restart the Agent.
systemctl restart datadog-agent
chkconfig datadog-agent   -->checking enable or not
aceess processes on datadog

5. yum install httpd -y && systemctl start httpd && systemctl enable httpd  --> install webserver
vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
:set number
/load  -->search for load module
:60
LoadModule status_module modules/mod_status.so
<Location /server-status>
SetHandler server-status
order deny,allow
Deny from all
Allow from all
Allow from <your-Private-IP>
</Location>
ExtendedStatus On

httpd -t  --->to check the changed httpd configurations right or wrong (syntax ok).
systemctl restart httpd  --> restart the server and wait for few minutes and the logs will be stored in datadog processes.

6. we can also monitor containers on datadog
